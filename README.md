# C64 Kernel Switch

*An Adapter For **[ASSY250469]**, The 'Short Board'.*

<br>

Since the BASIC is stored in the same ROM, some circuit is required to allow a stable access to BASIC, while the Kernal can be selected.

The kernal selection can be configured with jumpers, a switch or even with a micro controller.

+5V are provided on the pin header for this purpose.
