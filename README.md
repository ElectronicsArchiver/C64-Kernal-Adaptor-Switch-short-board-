# C64-Kernal-Adapter-Switch-short-board-
This is a Kernal Adapter/Switch for the Commodore C64, ASSY250469 (short board). 
Since the BASIC is stored in the same ROM, some circuit is required to allow a stable access to BASIC, while the Kernal can be selected.
The kernal selection can be configured with jumpers, a switch or even with a micro controller. +5V are provided on the pin header for this purpose.
